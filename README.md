# CS-Brain-Training
App Project for CSCI 3308

Repo Organization:

The folder Project_Writeups contains all of our writeups and presentation files. Within this file,
the Autodoc folder has subfolders for the html and latex outputs of running Doxygen on the
repo. In addition, the Deployment folder contains a signed APK of the project for
deployment.

Much of the interesting code is within the app folder.
All of our code for classes is kept in app/src/main/java/com/roninsamakun/csbraintraining.
The corresponding android layouts are kept in app/src/main/res/layout.
The files for testing are located at app/src/androidTest/java/com/roninsamakun/csbraintraining.

To run the code:

The deployment of the code is located within the Autodoc folder in Project_Writeups.
The simplest way to run this code would be to import it into Android Studio and run it from there.
Otherwise, one can install the Andy the Android Emulator program and run the
app-release.apk file.
